# Project-AMIS-MC-LP
The main purpose of this project is to develop an airport management information system (AMIS) software for efficient and reliable flight allocation processes depending on the availability of the airline providing the service and the city to which the flight is heading and the city of departure respectively.

This part is to define good practices in the use and management of git and GitHub, therefore I will try to use all possible tools of the environment to demonstrate the skills and competences of an individual and collaborative work, simulating a real environment and with multiple workers, which are supported in the different branches that I will generate throughout the development of the project.
