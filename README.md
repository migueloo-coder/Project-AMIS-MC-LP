# Project-AMIS-MC-LP
The main purpose of this project is to develop an airport management information system (AMIS) software for efficient and reliable flight allocation processes depending on the availability of the airline providing the service and the city to which the flight is heading and the city of departure respectively.
This repository is organized as follows:
1. It has three folders which are marked as "Principal Project","Project Functional", "Reviews and deliveries","Documents"
2. Each of the directories has different codes which are fully equipped and with development documentation
3. The reason for this form of organization is only to share a repository but with different phases of the project that I am developing, I call this phases because it is not a version as such, that is what the version control system is for, which each phase has its own internal versions and previously tags.
4. The purpose of this is only to send and display the entire project with a single repository in a single part.
